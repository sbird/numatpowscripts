This repo contains the data and code for the massive neutrino halofit model
described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.4416

It is very old code and may contain some unusual choices. 

Both the original massive neutrino model is shown (in fitter.py) and the model
based on Takahashi et al (in takahashi.py). 

Power spectra and parameter files are in the NU_DM directory.

Scripts starting make- make plots for various papers.

Code is in python2 and may or may not run.
